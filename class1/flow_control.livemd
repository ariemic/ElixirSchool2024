# Flow control

## Match operator =

Matching operator = is used in one of 3 ways:

* to assign value to variable
* to check if the value matches given pattern, pin operator `^` is useful when you want to check pattern without reassigning variable
* to extract data from more complex structures

see more [here](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/pattern-matching.html).

```elixir
x = 1
# x = 2
# x
# ^x = 2
```

```elixir
{:ok, value} = {:ok, :success}
value
```

```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3]
# [head | tail] = list
# head
# tail
# [^head, 2, b] = list
# b
# [a, b] = list
# [] = list
```

```elixir
{:error, %{:reason => reason}} = {:error, %{:reason => "something went wong", :code => 123}}
reason
```

## If / unless

```elixir
if true do
  IO.puts("This works!")
end

unless true do
  IO.puts("This will never be seen")
end

unless false do
  IO.puts("This will be seen")
end

if nil do
  IO.puts("This won't be seen")
else
  IO.puts("This will")
end
```

## Case

```elixir
earnings = 11

special_value = 12

case earnings do
  10 -> "you earn average salary"
  # pin operator
  ^special_value -> "you earn #{special_value}"
  salary when salary > 12 -> "you earn #{salary} you are too rich"
  _ -> "you are underpaid"
end
```

## Cond

`case` is useful when you need to match against different values. However, in many circumstances, we want to check different conditions and find the first one that does not evaluate to `nil` or `false`. If all of the conditions return nil or false, an error (`CondClauseError`) is raised. For this reason, it may be necessary to add a final condition, equal to `true`, which will always match

```elixir
cond do
  2 + 2 == 5 ->
    "This will not be true"

  2 * 2 == 3 ->
    "Nor this"

  1 + 1 == 2 ->
    "But this will"
end
```

```elixir
cond do
  2 + 2 == 5 ->
    "This is never true"

  2 * 2 == 3 ->
    "Nor this"

  true ->
    "This is always true (equivalent to else)"
end
```

## Anonymous functions

An anonymous function has no name. They allow us to store and pass executable code around as it was an integer or string. They are delimited by the keywords `fn` and `end`. To invoke anonymous funtion use sytnax `fun.(args...)`

```elixir
add = fn a, b -> a + b end
add.(2, 3)
# add_two = fn a -> add.(a, 2) end
# add_two.(5)
```

```elixir
# shorthand notation
add2 = &(&1 + &2)
add2.(2, 3)
```

Nie indeksujemy od 0 tylko od 1

```elixir
# Pattern meatching in annonimous functions:
count = fn
  1 -> :one
  2 -> :two
  _ -> :many
end

[
  count.(1),
  count.(2),
  count.(3),
  count.(4)
]
```

## Pipe operator

The `|>` symbol used in the snippet above is the pipe operator: it takes the output from the expression on its left side and passes it as the first argument to the function call on its right side. Itâ€™s similar to the Unix `|` operator. Its purpose is to highlight the data being transformed by a series of functions.

```elixir
add.(add.(1, 2), 3)
# 1
# |> add.(2)
# |> add.(3)
```

## Higher order functions

Functions that accept orther functions as arguments. Read more [here](https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-for-beginners#%E2%9E%A1%EF%B8%8F-higher-order-functions)

```elixir
devices =
  [
    %{:os => :mac, :processor => :intel, :type => :laptop},
    %{:os => :mac, :processor => :intel, :type => :phone},
    %{:os => :windows, :processor => :intel, :type => :laptop},
    %{:os => :android, :processor => :intel, :type => :phone},
    %{:os => :windows, :processor => :intel, :type => :phone}
  ]

  ## I want to know what type of divices are used  
  # devices
  # |> Enum.map(fn %{:type => type} -> type end)
  # |> Enum.uniq()

  ## I want to see the windows running divices
  # devices
  |> Enum.filter(fn
    %{:os => :windows} -> true
    _ -> false
  end)
```

## Modules

When writing Elixir code we use functions. And we put group of functions into modules.

There are 2 types of functions that we put inside modules:

* public - can only be accessed from anywhere in the code, defined with `def`
* private - can only be accessed within module, defined with `defp`

Function always return last value it evaluated

```elixir
defmodule Math.Examples.Fib do
  def fib(0), do: 1
  def fib(1), do: 1

  def fib(n) do
    fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
  end

  def seq_fib(max), do: piv_fib(max, 0, 1, 0)

  defp piv_fib(max, counter, current, _previous) when counter > max, do: current

  ## Handling the warining:
  ## warning: variable "previous" is unused (if the variable is not meant to be used, prefix it with an underscore)
  ## first_classes/basic_constructs.livemd#cell:11: Fibbonaci.Sequence.piv_fib/4

  # defp piv_fib(max, counter, current, _previous) when counter > max, do: current
  # defp piv_fib(max, counter, current, _) when counter > max, do: current

  defp piv_fib(max, counter, current, previous) do
    piv_fib(max, counter + 1, current + previous, current)
  end
end

defmodule Math.Examples.Add do
  def add(a, b) do
    a + b
    ## When you uncomment `:ok` it will be returned instead of a + b
    # :ok
  end
end
```

```elixir
{[
   Math.Examples.Fib.fib(0),
   Math.Examples.Fib.fib(1),
   Math.Examples.Fib.fib(2),
   Math.Examples.Fib.fib(3),
   Math.Examples.Fib.fib(4),
   Math.Examples.Fib.fib(5)
 ],
 [
   Math.Examples.Fib.seq_fib(0),
   Math.Examples.Fib.seq_fib(1),
   Math.Examples.Fib.seq_fib(2),
   Math.Examples.Fib.seq_fib(3),
   Math.Examples.Fib.seq_fib(4),
   Math.Examples.Fib.seq_fib(5)
 ]}
```

```elixir
Math.Examples.Add.add(2, 3)
```
